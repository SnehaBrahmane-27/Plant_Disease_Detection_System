# 🌿 PLANT DISEASE DETECTION SYSTEM

A multilingual, deep learning-powered web application that identifies plant diseases from leaf images and recommends appropriate treatments. Designed for accessibility and scalability, it features a user login system, treatment recommendations in multiple Indian languages, and a history tracking system — all within an intuitive tabbed interface using Streamlit.

## 📊 DATASET

The **Plant Disease Detection System** uses the **New Plant Diseases Dataset** from Kaggle, which consists of two main sets of plant images:

* **Training Set**: 70,295 images of plant leaves from various crops, used to train the deep learning model.
* **Testing Set**: 17,572 images, used to evaluate the model's performance.

### Dataset Source:

* **Source**: [New Plant Diseases Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)
